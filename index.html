            <h2 class="center title">About Me</h2>
            <p>     I recently graduated from Thinkful's Full Stack Flex bootcamp. Growing up, I found solving puzzles and building things with my hands to be a thrill, and I see coding in the same way. I've always loved tech, and now that I'm able to create code, I can finally see how things work in the background.
            </p>
            <p>     In my spare time, you can find me hiking and cycling, while also snagging a picture or two along the way. Photography is also a lifelong passion of mine. If I'm not enjoying the beautiful California weather, im indoors cooking up a storm.

            <p> Here I made a simple Cooking quiz application. I wanted to create a fun way to test your knowledge about various cooking terms and techniques to see who is truly a Master Chef. The quiz consists of 10 multiple choice questions created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
